Hi! My name is Gustavo Sarti, and this is my personal repository. Here I keep finished and unfinished projects, studies, tools, and other things I might come up with.

### üìö What I studied üéì
I have a degree in Social Sciences (USP), a master's degree in Sociology of Technology (UNICAMP), and a specialization in Data Science (Facens). I also took and am always taking several other more specific courses. The last good courses I took or am taking in the last months and years were:

* [Creating Amazing Games](https://hotmart.com/pt-br/marketplace/produtos/curso-de-criacao-de-jogos-tudo-o-que-voce-precisa-para-desenvolver-seu-game/M33703892S)
* [Real World Machine Learning](https://www.realworldml.net)
* [Master Entrepreneur](https://hotmart.com/pt-br/marketplace/produtos/empreendedor-mestre/M91064740J)
* [curso.dev](https://curso.dev/?fbclid=PAAabfSCdpqDL_LxOtlaEbZ9F3zvAWj-_SaqzOc6k7-wDvU2FGPTOGs-f9_Mc_aem_AbtLudraVaUz2PSLwJ5wEaEhekTYfdJBT5q_ibRHzSp8a5cDwZY_UWGhmQIzKm0d1neQoLyF6rRU7fFQyYnXXG3e)

### üõ†Ô∏è  Where I worked before üíº
My professional experiences were diverse. I started working in research in the field of anthropology and sociology. I worked for over two years with businesses intelligence focused on social media  of clients such as Ita√∫ bank and Philips. I produced, presented, recorded and edited two podcasts (both in portugese): [Maquina√ß√µes](https://maquinatudo.com.br/podcast) and [PrimeCast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5F1DmO9HIWty2ywJV8yPYV). For eight years I helped to organize, develop and curate the Espa√ßo de Tecnologias e Artes at Sesc-SP.

### üíª What I'm doing now ‚öôÔ∏è
I work at a [startup](https://n2vec.com/) in a position that is between data scientist and machine learning engineer. In this position I have been working mainly with Natural Language Processing (NLP) in tasks ranging from data mining, pre-processing, analysis to the application of machine-learning techniques such as clustering, classification, entity extraction (NER) and information extraction with LLMs (RAG).

In my free time I create games, courses and other projects with some friends in the collective [M√°quina Tudo](https://maquinatudo.com.br/). This is my main space to express my creativity and my artistic desires. Games, and in particular tabletop RPGs, were an important part of my personal development. Being able to create my own games and take them to a few thousand people in dozens of cities has been a wonderful process.

### ü§ù Recognitions I received üèÜ
A friend once told me something that never left my head: "It's strange to be average in amazing places. You always have the (wrong) feeling that we're not enough". My background was in two of the best universities in Brazil and in a good engineering school. I always studied with very good teachers and worked in amazing teams with very talented and generous people.

Having said that, I had three recognitions that were very important to me:

I was chosen for the Internet Governance School of the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI/NIC.br)
I received the scholarship for the South School of Internet Governance which took place at the headquarters of the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington-DC
I was selected for a Fapesp Technical Training Level 5 (TT-V) scholarship to work with NLP.

### üëã Beyond üí¨
I am restless, curious and I like to do things. That's why I end up getting interested in many things, which last a short time with me like crochet or bird identification or which are almost daily companions for years like D&D and martial arts.

Because I like so many things, we probably have something in common. So if you want to chat you can find me as @gmsarti out there. Just say hi.

See you later.
